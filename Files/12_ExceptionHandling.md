# Exception Handling

Exceptions are Runtime Errors.

There are many types of errors:

1. Syntax Error - can be removed with the help of compiler.

2. Logical Error - can be removed with the help of debugger.

3. Runtime Error - can be resolved with the help of Exception Handling.

   . Mishandling of a program causes Runtime error.

   . Causes of runtime errors are bad input or unavailability of resources.

   . Exception handling is process of responding to the runtime errors

Syntax and Logical errors are faced by Programmers, and runtime
errors are faced by user

```java
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int a = 10;
      int b = 0;
      try
      {
         int c = a/b;
         System.out.println(c);
      }
      catch(ArithmeticException e)
      {
         System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
      }
      System.out.println("Program ends");
   }
}
```

## Built-in Exception Classes

Object is the mother class for all the java classes.

Exception is the parent class for all the exceptions.

```java
Exception
   ClassNotFoundException
   IOException
   InterruptedException
   NumberFormatException
   RuntimeException
      ArithmeticException
      ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
      NullPointerException
```

```java
// Exception Class Methods
String getMessage();          // System.out.println(e.getMessage());
String toString();            // System.out.println(e);
// These methods returns a string with a message written about exception, purpose of both the methods is same, but the usage of both the methods are different.
void printStackTrace();       // e.printStackTrace();
// This prints the stack trace of the exception (Sequence of Method calls).
```

Exception classes are categorised into two types:

1. Checked exception must be handle by try and catch, java compiler
   forces you to write try and catch.

2. Unchecked exception are not mandatory to be handled, Only Runtime
   Exceptions are the unchecked exceptions.

## Custom Exception Classes

```java
class NegativeDimensionException extends Exception {
   public String toString() {
      return "Dimensions cannot be negative";
   }
}
```

```java
public int area(int a, int b) throws NegativeDimensionException
{
   if(a<0 || b<0) {
      throw new NegativeDimensionException();
   }
   return a*b;
}
```

## Propagation of Exception

```java
public class Main {
   static int method1() {
      return 10/0;
   }
   static void method2() {
      method1();
   }
   static void method3() {
      method2();
   }
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try
      {
         method3();
      }
      catch(ArithmeticException e)
      {
         System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
      }
   }
}
```

Output:

```sh
Cannot divide by zero
```

Even though, the exception occured in `method1()`, It was passed on to its calling methods, and finally was handled in `main()`.

## Throw vs Throws

`throw` keyword is used to throw an exception logically.

Only one exception can be thrown at a time by using `throw` keyword.

We can catch the exception in the same function using `try` and `catch` block.

```java
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      int a = 10, b = 0;
      try
      {
         if(b==0)
            throw new ArithmeticException();
         int c = a/b;
         System.out.println(c);
      }
      catch(ArithmeticException e)
      {
         System.out.println("Cannot divide by zero");
      }
   }
}
```

---

`throws` keyword is used to pass the exception to the calling function.

`throws` is used for declaring that a method may throw exception.

```java
class NegativeDimensionException extends Exception {
   public String toString() {
      return "Dimensions cannot be negative";
   }
}

public class Main {
   static int area(int a, int b) throws NegativeDimensionException {
      if(a<0 || b<0) {
         throw new NegativeDimensionException();
      }
      return a*b;
   }

   static void method1() throws NegativeDimensionException {
      System.out.println("Area is " + method1(-5,10));
   }

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try
      {
         method1();
      }
      catch(NegativeDimensionException e)
      {
         System.out.println(e);
      }
   }
}
```

Firstly we generated exception in `area()`, and If we don't want to handle it inside that function, then we can pass it on to the calling function using `throws` keyword in the function name.

## finally Block

`finally` keyword is used in association with a try/catch block.

`finally` keyword is meant to execute whether an exception occurs or not.

Resources are needed to be closed in `finally` block.

It is useful when we're not handling all the exceptions in the program.

```java
public class Mai {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      try
      {
         throw new Exception();
      }
      finally
      {
         System.out.println("Finally block");
      }
   }
}

```

Output:

```sh
Finally block
```

Here, we haven't handled the particular exception, but still the `finally` block was executed.

## Try with resources

Garbage Collector only releases the heap memory(Heap memory is resource).

Programmer is responsible for releasing the other resources(Network, Database, Files).

```java
int method1() throws Exception {
   FileReader f;

   try
   {
      f = new FileReader("abc.txt");
      // Use File
   }
   finally
   {
      f.close();
   }

   return result;
}
```

This is a proper code, for handling with resources.

---

`try` with resources, automatically closes the resources.

To avoid `finally` block(to close the acquired resources), we use `try` with resources.

```java
int method1() throws Exception {

   try(FileReader f = new FileReader("abc.txt")) {
      // Use File
      return result;
   }
}
```

`try` block wil automatically release the acquired resources after it finishes its execution.
