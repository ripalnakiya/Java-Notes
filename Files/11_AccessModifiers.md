A Class can have three type of members : variables, methods and inner classes.

```java
class Outer
{
    int x;

    void show()
    {
        // Implementation
    }

    class Inner
    {
        // Implementation
    }
}
```

All access modifiers can be used on the members of class.

Outer class can only be `defualt` and `public`, It cannot be private or protected.

Class Can be used in two ways:

Either by creating its object, or by Inheriting it.

```java
class Test
{
    // Implementation
}
```

```java
// HAS-A relationship
// This class HAS-A object of Test
class Demo1
{
    Test t = new Test();
}
```

```java
// IS-A relationship
// This class IS-A Test class
class Demo2 extends Test
{
    // Implementation
}
```
