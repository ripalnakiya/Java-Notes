# Annotations

Annotations are useful for giving meta data to class or interface or a method.

There are some Built-in annotations that are **Applied to code**:

These are set of annotations applied upon the code. This type of annotation gives the hint to the compiler so that it avoids showing errors and warnings.

The in-built annotations applied to the code are:

@Override:
It informs the compiler that the element is meant to override an element declared in a superclass.

@Deprecated:
It indicates that the marked element is deprecated and should no longer be used.

@FunctionalInterface:
Indicates that the type declaration is intended to be a functional interface (Lamda Expression i.e. only one method)

@SuppressWarnings:
It tells the compiler to suppress specific warnings that it would otherwise generate.

@SafeVarArgs:
When it is applied to a method or a constructor, it asserts that the code does not perform potentially unsafe operations on its varargs parameter.
